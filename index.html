                                 Eilish was born on December 18, 2001, in Los Angeles, California. Her parents, Maggie Baird and Patrick O’Connell, were longtime actors before joining their teenage daughter's professional team. Eilish's full name is Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell. Her first name is in honor of her maternal grandfather, William; the second was inspired by a conjoined twin her parents saw in a documentary; and the third came from the insistence of her older brother, Finneas.

                                 Raised in a two-bedroom house in Highland Park where she and her brother were homeschooled, Eilish was encouraged to pursue her interests in dance gymnastics, horseback riding and especially music. She learned to play the Beatles "I Will" on th ukulele at age 6; joined Los Angeles Children' Chorus at age 8; and began writing songs in earnes by age 11, her talents nurtured through her mother's songwriting class. Eilish has said her first "real song, "Fingers Crossed," was penned around that tim after watching an episode of The Walking Dead.

                                 Eilish began earning her first major accolades in 2019 when she claimed wins at the MTV Video Awards and American Music Awards and was named Billboard's Woman of the Year. But her big moment came at the January 2020 Grammys, when she became the first woman and the second artist overall to sweep the "big four" categories of Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best New Artist, adding Best Pop Vocal Album for good measure.

                                 Eilish became known for wearing oversized clothing, a style born from discomfort with her body that bolstered her appeal as the antithesis of the polished pop starlet. She met the demand for her signature apparel with the early 2018 launch of her online shop, Blohsh, and established her own niche in the fashion world by signing with Next Models later that year.
